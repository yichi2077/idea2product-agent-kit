- Major functionality broken (login, task creation, sync)
- Security vulnerability discovered

### Rollback Steps

1. Disable feature flags (`recurring_tasks_enabled`, `new_nav_enabled`)
2. If flag disable insufficient: Push App Store emergency update reverting to v2.9
3. Communicate to users via in-app banner and email
4. Post incident channel update (#launch-v3-war-room)

### Rollback Owner

David Park - david@taskflow.io - +1-555-0123

### Rollback Time Estimate

- Feature flag disable: <5 minutes
- App store rollback: 24-48 hours (Apple review)
